    <h1>Hows your ~/junkcode</h1>
    <h4>2009/10/29</h4>
    <p>At <a href="http://www.linux.org.au/conf/2004/">LCA 2004</a> <a href="https://www.samba.org/~tridge/">Andrew Tridgell</a> gave an excellent <a href="https://linux.org.au/linux-conf-au/abstracts.html#122">presentation</a> on his <a href="https://github.com/tridge/junkcode/">junkcode</a> directory. A few snippets from the <a href="http://samba.org/ftp/tridge/talks/junkcode.pdf">presentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most programmers write bits of junkcode at one time or another. It&rsquo;s an important part of learning to be a better programmer.</p>
<p>In this talk I hope to convince you to value your junkcode, and to keep it rather than deleting it when it has served its initial purpose. Today&rsquo;s junk can help you build tomorrows killer app.</p>
<p>Your junkcode directory forms a type of toolbox.</p>
<p>Instead of telling people “I once wrote a program that does that” I can say “here is a program that does that”. A great way to impress the boss!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can download the entire presentation <a href="http://samba.org/ftp/tridge/talks/junkcode.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found having a junkcode directory a valuable part of my toolbox as a programmer and consider myself fortunate that I was able to attend a talk that provided me with a life long lesson.</p>
