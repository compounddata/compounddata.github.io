      <title>dotfiles with ansible</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used stow for a while to manage my dotfiles but recently have moved to ansible.
One problem I had with stow was how to handle work and personal dotfiles. Consider gitconfig where user.email would be my personal email address for my personal machines and my work email address for my work machine. Using ansible templates to handle this using a single gitconfig template is the solution that I&amp;rsquo;m finding is working nicely for me right now.</description>

      <description>At LCA 2004 Andrew Tridgell gave an excellent presentation on his junkcode directory. A few snippets from the presentation:
Most programmers write bits of junkcode at one time or another. It&amp;rsquo;s an important part of learning to be a better programmer.
In this talk I hope to convince you to value your junkcode, and to keep it rather than deleting it when it has served its initial purpose. Today&amp;rsquo;s junk can help you build tomorrows killer app.</description>
